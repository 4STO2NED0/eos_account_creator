	  <p>This website allows you to create an EOS account if you don't have one yet. The way EOS works is that new accounts can only be created by someone with an existing account. Creating an account also requires to stake a certain amount of EOS and to buy some RAM. If you create an EOS account on this website, it comes with 0.2 EOS staked for CPU and Network bandwidth as well as 4KB of RAM.</p>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h4>Why do I need this service?</h4>
		<p>The way EOS works is that new accounts can only be created by someone with an existing account. If you didn't buy EOS when it was still an ERC-20 token, there is currently no other way to get an EOS account.</p>
		<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
		<p>The cost of one EOS account is currently USD {{price_usd|floatformat:2}}</p>
		<h4>Which payment methods do you accept?</h4>
		<p>Currently, only cryptocurrency payment is accepted. We accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. Fiat payment via credit card will be integrated if there is enough demand.</p>
		<h4>Is this website secure?</h4>
		<p>I built this website because it's a useful service for the EOS community. And of course, I make a small amount of profit with every purchase. If you have questions, please get in touch through our <a href="https://t.me/eos_account_creator">telegram group</a>.</p>
