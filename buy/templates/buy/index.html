	  <p>This website allows you to create an EOS account if you don't have one yet. The way EOS works is that new accounts can only be created by someone with an existing account. Creating an account also requires to stake a certain amount of EOS and to buy some RAM. If you create an EOS account on this website, it comes with 0.2 EOS staked for CPU and Network bandwidth as well as 4KB of RAM.</p>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h4>Why do I need this service?</h4>
		<p>The way EOS works is that new accounts can only be created by someone with an existing account. If you have a friend who has an EOS account, you can ask him to create one for you. If you don't, this website can be your friend for a small fee.</p>
		<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
		<p>The cost of one EOS account is currently USD {{price_usd|floatformat:2}}. Included in the price are 0.2 staked EOS that will be transferred to your control and 4 KB of RAM.</p>
		<h4>Which payment methods do you accept?</h4>
		<p>Currently, only cryptocurrency payment is accepted. We accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. Fiat payment via credit card will be integrated if there is enough demand. Please understand that we can currently only offer this service to customers outside of the EU (european union).</p>
		<h4>Why is EOS not accepted?</h4>
		<p>If you already have an EOS account, you don't need this tool. You can use the excellent <a href="https://toolkit.genereos.io/tools" target="_new">EOS Toolkit by GenerEOS</a>. If you currently have EOS on an exchange only, it's not possible to use it for payment. You have to withdraw it to your own wallet first. The reason is that other cryptocurrencies let you create an individual receiving address per payment. On EOS, this is not possible, one has to use the memo field in the transfer. As far as I know, most exchanges don't let you use a custom memo when withdrawing.
		</p>
		<h4>Is this tool open source?</h4>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/angelol/eos_account_creator" target="_new">Yes!</a>
		</p>
		<h4>Is this website safe to use?</h4>
		<p>I built this website because it's a useful service for the EOS community. The source code is on <a href="https://github.com/angelol/eos_account_creator" target="_new">GitHub</a> and can be audited. The activity of this website can be checked on the EOS blockchain. This tool uses the EOS account <b>accountcreat</b> to generate new accounts, the <a href="https://eostracker.io/accounts/accountcreat">activity can be checked</a> in any block explorer. If you have further questions, please get in touch through our <a href="https://t.me/eos_account_creator" target="_new">telegram group</a>.</p>
